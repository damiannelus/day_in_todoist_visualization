# My day in todoist

Creative approach toward visualizing a day in todoist

## TODO list

1. ✅ ~~stub agents;~~
2. ✅ ~~Display agents and let them flow;~~
3. ✅ ~~Stub "floor" agents (in the future - tasks that miss the due date)~~
4. ✅ ~~Animate "floor" and existing agents.~~
5. ✅ ~~Write tests~~
6. ✅ ~~Hooks vs regular checks.~~
7. ✅ ~~Add task and project models.~~
8. ✅ ~~Refactor!~~
9. Test DAO.
10. Test middleware/todoist.
11. ✅ ~~Obtain data from the Todoist and map to local models.~~
12. ✅ ~~Obtain data from sync API (done tasks)~~
